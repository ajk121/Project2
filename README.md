HeartBIT

HeartBIT was my second project for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

It's a dating website for tech people that allows users to interact with other people via message.

Users can keep track of visits to their profile and of the profiles they have visited

Users can choose a basic or premium account and will be able to send and receive messages only when premium.

The back-end side of the app was done with ruby on rails, while the frontend is custom css/sass.

The following gems have been used in the project:

Devise Oauth CanCan Ransack Carrierwave Kaminari Impressionist

Note: this was a 3 people group project on which i contributed both on the back and front end. There is a forked version of the original one that i'm using to apply some changes and to deploy to heroku. Please take a look at the repo called HeartBIT if interested.
